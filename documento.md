firstly I have created 'work' branch using *git branch work* command, then I moved to that branch in order to change the workflows using *git checkout work*, I only have added on line 4 and 7 the name of the new branch 'work' into the array.

Once I have saved the changes, I have pushed it to the new branch and I have checked that it works

finally I have changed README.md adding the staff that are written on the wiki (name, CI action, ...)
